Trinity Mobile 0.1.0 is released under the open source Mozilla Public License Version 2.0.  You are free to use and modify the source as long as you adhere to the requirements of the MPL 2.0.  You can find a complete copy of the MPL 2.0 in the included LICENSE file and each source file contains an appropriate licensing header block comment.

Before you build:

Trinity Mobile was built using Eclipse (www.eclipse.org), the Google Android SDK (developer.android.com/sdk), and third-party JavaScript tools or libraries.  Trinity Mobile is not associated with Eclipse, Google, Android, jQuery Mobile, the jquery-ui-map plugin, or PhoneGap in any way.

Trinity Mobile uses a couple of third-party JavaScript libraries that are not included in this source.  You will need to download and include these libraries in any build of Trinity Mobile in order for certain features to work properly.

jquery-ui-map - Google Maps Version 3 plugin for JQuery Mobile, available here: http://code.google.com/p/jquery-ui-map/

PhoneGap - available here: http://phonegap.com/

Trinity Mobile also uses jQuery Mobile, but the JQM library is hosted by the JQM creators so downloading JQM is not necessary.


Building:

It is recommended you use PhoneGap and Eclipse with an appropriate Android SDK to build Trinity Mobile.  Setting up the environment is outside the scope of this document, but the PhoneGap website has instructions that will walk you through how to do that.

Once you have the environment set up, place all of the Trinity Mobile files and folders into your /<workspace>/<project>/assets/www folder.  Copy the phonegap and the jquery-ui-map JavaScript files into the assets/www/scripts/ folder.  If the version numbers are different from the version numbers referenced in the head of the index.html, indexa.html, etc files, change the script tags that include those files to reflect the correct version numbers.

Try to run the project in your Android Emulator.
